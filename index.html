        <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>

        <p>
            Ada Lovelace is often considered the first computer programmer. She worked with Charles Babbage
            on his Analytical Engine and was one of the first to recognize that machines could do more than
            calculate numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Her notes on Babbage’s machine included what is now recognized as the first published algorithm
            intended for implementation on a computer. This foresight showed her deep understanding of
            abstract computation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lovelace’s work continues to inspire computer scientists, especially women entering the field.
            Her vision laid the foundation for thinking of computers as more than number-crunching machines.
